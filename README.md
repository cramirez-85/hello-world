Yes, hello. My name is Chris Ramirez. Unfortunatly someone took my desired username so I was forced to add a single hyphen to it which makes me irrationally angry. I like to do photography as a hobbyist, play games and watch shows/movies. I most enjoy said entertainment when it has philosophical themes.
